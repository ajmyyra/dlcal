dlCal - Calendar software with focus on deadlines

Just a quick node.js - React - Android app project 
for a course Mobile Cloud Computing in Aalto University.

We'll see if I'll actually write a proper README.

Configuration is stored in config.js, so you'll need one too. Here's an example:

module.exports = {
    'secret': 'therearetoofewnomihoudaisinfinland',
    'database': 'mongodb://localhost:27017/dlcal'
}
